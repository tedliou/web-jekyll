On one side of the balance is the power of the state with its vast resources and organizations, though it requires the legitimacy of governance. On the other side are the people, who claim to be the masters and who possess the ultimate power, but often create a lot of noise. This leads us to a dilemma between expecting the government to be competent, yet not wanting to be free of its hold on us; and between encouraging social diversity, yet wanting to succeed together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Modern-day constitutionalism offers checks and balances through the separation of powers, and parliamentary politics and media freedom ensure a diversity of views and consolidate public opinion. Democracy relies on these mechanisms to build up mutual trust so that the ball suspended in flight will not land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📢 Freedom of speech is, without a doubt, a crucial cornerstone in this trust mechanism, and speech must be transparent and authentic. The danger of disinformation is obvious: saying the wrong thing or lying is often easier than telling the truth; thus, the saying that “a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📰 Traditionally, we rely on the parliament and the media as gatekeepers to maintain the delicate balance of this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 The Internet has brought about enormous changes. Receiving information, expressing opinions, and even mobilizing the masses no longer require the parliament or the media—anyone can become a public opinion leader, or even part of the media itself — a hashtag on a social media network can start an avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💥 Mutual trust, already fragile in itself, has become all the more vulnerable. Organized operations to spread untruths take advantage of the weaknesses of social media, such as information overload and algorithm opacity. Disinformation can be disseminated quickly, feeding continuously on similar content, strengthening existing views, and forming alliances of shared opinion. The environment of online discourse is becoming increasingly segregated, the foundations of mutual trust are being gradually eroded, structures of power and trust are collapsing, and the juggling balls of democracy are scattered on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔔 The spread of disinformation has become the Achilles heel for the good governance of democracy. The intuitive response is to introduce protections through legal control. Singapore, for example, has passed the «Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act», which offers the government the power to order individuals or the media to remove disinformation. Another case in point is Germany’s NetzDG, which requires major social media platforms to self-censor as a check and balance and to remain transparent to the public. Yet doesn’t handing over the power of takedowns to the administration create a new problem in place of the former? Turning to multinational companies alone will not improve things either. Currently, business operations and algorithms lack transparency and checks and balances even more severely than states, so putting machines in the role of a governor is not an option either — especially for a conservative anarchist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔔 It is said that addressing the source of trouble should end it. Since the problem comes from the dissemination of information from the media to the community, it is only by empowering civil society to participate in the reconstruction of trust that social norms may be co-created, that power may be conferred to communities that anyone can enter and leave at any time, and that the risk of abuse from the concentration of power may be minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📧 The relentless outpouring of junk mail that flooded into every mailbox once almost led to a catastrophic email crisis. Yet this problem was not solved through powerful legislative control, but rather through community initiatives that prompted email servers to provide users with the power to mark junk mail. Junk mail that was marked by everyone was then intercepted by the system and moved to a different inbox without any messages being deleted. If the mail was considered useful information, it could still be located again and marked as clean. Therefore, power was not concentrated in the hands of any one person or business, and users retained their autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💊 Taiwan has taken a similar route in responding to disinformation. Primarily, it does not rely on legal control but rather urges major social media platforms or information tool operators such as Facebook, LINE, and Google to simultaneously sign standards of self-regulatory practice. In addition to establishing protections on the technical front, increasing oversight and transparency on political advertisement, and strengthening media competency across all age groups, it is important to cooperate with third parties to build an independent, transparent, and fair supervision mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔬 Third-party fact-checking mechanisms in Taiwan, such as Taiwan FactCheck Center, MyGoPen, and Rumor &amp;amp; Truth, are mostly independent private organizations. Because they lack manpower and funding, opening up to public participation is inevitable. Many technological developments and fact-checking work were completed by volunteers, for example through the Cofacts project. Public participation allows these social sector contributors to keep a healthy distance while working with the government and businesses and to maintain internal checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📖 The same logic of citizen-centered service design is also applicable to the cultivation of media competence. Rather than dogmatically educating students or the people on how to distinguish the Internet’s relentless tide of information, it is much better to help everyone recognize that we on the Internet can act as media and learn to contextualize a piece of information more profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 Because the government’s organizations and resources are vast, it is incumbent on them to provide timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand information to the public and to allow third parties to fact-check. The Executive Yuan adopts the “2-2-2 principle” in expecting prompt clarifications from each ministry within 2 hours and 200 words, with the inclusion of 2 images (a majority of which are completed within 1 hour after the disinformation is disclosed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤣 Humor plays a crucial role here. &lt;strong&gt;Memetic engineering&lt;/strong&gt;—that is, the “package the message in such a way that you cannot help but be tempted to share it”—enables accurate information to be disseminated more quickly. If it is possible for the accurate information to immediately follow disinformation, it can similarly gain just as much traction, a strategy that we call “humor over rumor”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌈 In 2019, the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation released a “Declaration of Digital Interdependence,” emphasizing the need to establish a decentralized and common governance framework (“COGOV”). To rebuild the democratic ecosystem of the digital age, it is necessary to change the relationship of checks and balances between the government and the people into a three-way relationship in which the government, businesses, and the people work together and depend on one another. It is only this way we can resist the invasion of disinformation and regain the ecological balance a democratic society needs to give the juggling balls in the air the energy they need to freely fly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">The same logic of citizen-centered service design is also applicable to the cultivation of media competence.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b767afb58e1e32b1b9eb887707412b1a6db06188_2_1380x886.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b767afb58e1e32b1b9eb887707412b1a6db06188_2_1380x886.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Radical Markets achieves the Great Unity: Classical value of the twenty-first century</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%A4%E5%85%B8%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Radical Markets achieves the Great Unity: Classical value of the twenty-first century" /><published>2020-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%A4%E5%85%B8%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%A4%E5%85%B8%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC/">&lt;p&gt;🙋 Two years ago, Glen Weyl and Eric Posner jointly published the Radical Markets, which triggered extensive discussions and responses. According to Glen and Eric, when it comes to public affairs, people tend to disagree and refuse to share information they keep to themselves. If a well-designed market mechanism is in place to make more people willing to express their true ideas in public, then the communities can work together to find more proper solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖖 Based on the idea of promoting public interest with a market mechanism, they selected social issues from five different fields and came up with five proposals through the mechanism design. Now the introduction of a traditional Chinese version of the book, in my opinion, is meaningful for Taiwanese readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-liquidity-via-an-auction-system&quot;&gt;Promote liquidity via an auction system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💰 Why is it meaningful? Take the Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST) of Chapter 1 for example. People may attach to their properties any value they want, but they must pay a certain percentage of tax every year. Once someone offers to purchase the properties according to the value they set, the property owners cannot refuse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📝 No doubt, Taiwanese people cannot be more familiar with such practice because it extends what’s proposed by Sun Yat-sen—”Equalization of land rights.” This concept holds that all landowners should assess the increased value of their land deriving from the common development of a community, and announce the land value they assess every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 If the estimated value is on the high side, the landowners need to pay higher taxes, which is taxation according to the declared land value. If the assessed value is lower than the actual reasonable value, the government may purchase the land at such value, which represents the government purchase of land according to the declared land value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔨 However, it is the government that decides whether or not to purchase the land according to the declared value. If the government does not take action, the land value will be meaningless. Yet, with a COST, anyone may purchase it at the declared price. Therefore, it becomes an auction system. Because of fixed taxes and the market mechanism, the possessors are willing to disclose the real value of their properties, thus facilitating the sufficient application of properties and also preventing stockpiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-type-of-democratic-governance&quot;&gt;A new type of democratic governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🗳️ Another mechanism that operated in Taiwan is Quadratic Voting (QV) mentioned in Chapter 2. QV was initially designed to solve the following problems: the universally adopted majority rule is likely to cause strategic voting and thus cannot reveal the true preferences of individuals. Besides, the “one man, one vote” system cannot effectively demonstrate the strength of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 The QV system, in which more credits need to be spent for more intense votes, allows the marginal utility of every vote to be exactly equal to the marginal cost. Then, it gives people greater motivation to vote according to their actual preferences to avoid wasting costs. Furthermore, the discussion of public topics will have a higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇹🇼 Take Taiwan’s Presidential Hackathon for example. Since 2019, we have started using QV to vote for proposals. Each participant will get 99 credits. One vote costs one credit; four credits will buy two votes, and nine credits will buy three votes. In other words, the cost of a number of votes is its square in credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🗽 We noticed that during the voting of the Presidential Hackathon people tried to avoid concentrated votes and polarized results, although they allocated their votes. It’s because they have limited credits, and the cost of ballot stuffing is quite high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 Outside Taiwan, there’s a case that readers may learn about. In 2019, the House of Representatives in Colorado adopted QV to vote for the budget distribution. This set a milestone for the new type of democratic governance. The good thing about QV is that senators find such an outcome acceptable because senators prefer voting for several different budget bills. That way, even if only one or two bills are passed in the end, they will be deemed to have contributed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;labor-cooperative-of-data&quot;&gt;Labor Cooperative of Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Through the connection between equalization of land rights and COST, and the implementation of QV by the Presidential Hackathon, you can see that social and democratic system innovation is a common thing in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 In my view, another practice that will probably be experimented with in Taiwan is “Data as Labor” discussed in Chapter 5. Cooperatives and mutual aid societies are well-established traditions in Taiwan. It’s better to bring together a group of workers to determine what different tasks to undertake, rather than have a boss to decide everything. It is why the cooperative was established in the first place. The benefits created by people with different expertise are certainly greater than those by a single person. Besides, it can increase the average income per person. This is the so-called labor cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌹 The concept of “Data as Labor” is similar to the labor cooperative. For example, the AirBox devices that represent the cooperation of the Academia Sinica and non-governmental organizations and that can monitor air quality are distributed across Taiwan via public adoption. The collected data is announced on the air pollution observation website (https://airmap.g0v.tw/). Therefore, the public may keep abreast of the air quality of Taiwan through another channel without completely relying on the monitoring station of the Environmental Protection Administration. As you can see, when data labors are organized, their value is infinite, and they will be utilized in varied ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 The prerequisite for such practice is that all individuals regard themselves as the producers of data and that they have the right to copy, modify, or delete their personal assets at any time. In this way, a new cooperative relationship will emerge. For instance, due to the recent demand for online purchase of face masks, many people have downloaded the mobile application of the National Health Insurance Administration and found that they may have access to their face mask taking records whenever they want to. On this basis, we can consider its application. For example, we can share the unused quotas with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as dedications to the international medical workers. The records on the mobile application will be the proof. Hence, we provide direct feedback on the data value, which is the most important significance of “Data as Labor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤓 What’s introduced above are three methods from the book. Also, there is the Visas Between Individuals Program (VIP) that improves the issue of migrants through the sponsoring system and the method of prohibiting institutional investors from diversifying in the same industry to avoid the monopoly of capitalists. All these approaches deserve to be studied in depth by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 As far as I can see, what the world can learn from Taiwan’s experience is that it carries out field experiments and turns these theories into practical tools. From the Taiwan Scholar Association and the Management Commission to the enterprises and government departments, as long as they have a new organization or project, we can apply and even improve these participation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💯 For example, Glen set up RadicalxChange (RxC), a non-profit organization, to spread these approaches, and I was invited to serve on the board. At the quarterly board meetings, we vote for the proposals in the form of QV. Each board member has 100 voice credits. Anyone may propose a motion and everyone can vote for or against that motion. The remaining credits can be used next quarter on a discount basis. In this way, it not only ensures that the approved proposals represent the true intention of the board members but also facilitates discussions of higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😺 RxC, based on the Radical Markets, keeps studying how to use these mechanism designs to address the problem of resource allocation that both the market and the government fail to resolve. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and also the board member of RxC, developed the quadratic funding (QF), using the QV system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎓 This novel funding mechanism is designed to solve the free-rider problem that often occurs in the process of using public goods. It will go through the Round 5 experiment on the blockchain platform called Gitcoin. Interested readers may refer to the essay “Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral among Communities,” that was jointly written by Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl, the author of this book, and Zoë Hitzig, a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University, and the “Review of Gitcoin Grants Quadratic Funding Round 4”, an analysis of Vitalik Buterin according to the Gitcoin’s experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 Throughout history, new ideological trends have emerged to boost social innovation in all ages and bring forth theories and tools that serve as an important means of improving human situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 After sorting out Taiwan experience, I realized that the Radical Markets has not just provided a batch of brand-new tools. More importantly, these seemingly radical proposals in the book are more like the activation of the traditional concept of Great Unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 They encourage all people to properly apply the production results and wealth instead of hiding them for their own purposes. This echoes with what’s described in the World of Great Unity, “People hate to see resources lying idle or cast away, but they do not necessarily keep them for themselves.” Individuals use what they have to offer substantial feedback on and contributions to public topics. This manifests the spirit of “They hate not to make use of their abilities, but they do not necessarily work for self-interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ For Taiwanese people, all these embody the classical value that already exists in their community rather than being radical approaches. Hence, I sincerely hope that the publication of the traditional Chinese version can spawn more intellectual inquiries and discussions and start a new chapter of the World of Great Unity with the classical value of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">For Taiwanese people, all these embody the classical value that already exists in their community rather than being radical approaches.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/997ce7f4a6d8b61e62021dfad4ce3707a995f42b_2_1380x920.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/997ce7f4a6d8b61e62021dfad4ce3707a995f42b_2_1380x920.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Collaboration across physical distance</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%AE%93%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A2%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collaboration across physical distance" /><published>2020-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%AE%93%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A2%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%AE%93%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A2%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/">&lt;p&gt;🏫 Faced with the spread of the epidemic, the world feeling tense and nerves are frayed. In order to prevent the spread of infection in groups, companies started distance work and schools prepared online courses. Recently, the Central Epidemic Command Center also proposed to suspend gatherings of more than a hundred people indoors and more than five hundred people outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏠 How to set up gatherings over long distances, both safety and with high-quality communication, is a problem the whole world is trying to save. The Hack at Home! hackathon, set up by the Taiwan citizen technology group g0v in March, has contributed a good example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 As one of the three largest open source technology groups in the world, g0v’s in-person hackathon, held every two months, is a vital time for community participation. At the hackathon location, anyone can take three minutes to present their proposal, and then find like-minded partners to work on it together. For example, the fact-checking information LINE  chatbot “Cofacts”, or the Ministry of Education’s Mandarin dictionary, “moedict”, which I participated in, all originated from g0v hackathons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☑️ In February of this year, in light of the increasing severity of the epidemic, the g0v community decided to “advance deployment”, and confirmed through an open vote that the March hackathon would be changed to “Hack at Home!”, with online participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍕 However, these hackathons easily draw hundreds of participants, and there are even many participants from the international community. How to ensure a stable connection, and to maintain an atmosphere of participation is the key to the success of “Hack at Home!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎥 In this regard, the participant Ronny used the open-source software Jitsi Meet to set up an online conference room, and integrated the writing tool HackMD, allowing participants to write code together on Slack while watching the live broadcast in real-time.  To make discussions and feedback more immediate and meet the discussion needs of different projects, “Hack at Home” also provided a streaming channel at the same time, so that interested participants could talk on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 In the end, “Hack at Home” was an unforgettable day for more than 150 participants from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States. This set of connection mechanisms using open source software and totally self-developed components has even attracted community partners including the Association for Progressive Communications and Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👐 No matter where you are, the internet can break down the barriers of distance and everyone can work with the rest of the world to solve problems. “Collaboration across physical distance, contribute solutions to the pandemic.” That is the inspiration I got from participating at “Hack at Home!” that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚦 In fact, the Article 8.1.1 and Article 8.1.3 in the Freeway and Expressway Traffic Control Regulations issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications stipulated that “Any slower small vehicles whose speed is below 80 km/hr on the freeway sections whose speed limit is over 90 km/hr…should be kept on the outer lanes. They can access the adjacent outer lanes temporarily should they wish to pass the vehicles in front.” “The inner lanes are the passing lanes. However, small vehicles may travel on the inner lanes within the speed limit specified for the road section in question as long as they do not hold up the traffic.” Yet, according to Article 8.2, “Small vehicles may be exempt from the restrictions of Article 8.1.1 and Article 8.1.3 if there’s a traffic jam.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Besides, according to the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act, if vehicle drivers fail to drive on the inner lanes as required, they shall be fined from NT$3,000 to NT$6,000. The National Highway Police Bureau (NHPB) issued more than 36,000 tickets against such violators from 2017 to 2019. Hence, Hon’s proposal to regard the inner lanes as the passing lanes not only has a legal basis but also has aligned with the enforcement measures of recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⛰️ However, Taiwan has its reasons for setting freeway speed limits. On the one hand, they need to consider the downtown section and the complex terrain, such as plains, hills, and plateaus, which results in numerous bends. Therefore, it’s hard to allow an infinite speed. On the other hand, the Institute of Transportation, MOTC, released “An analysis of traffic accidents before and after the freeway speed limit adjustment” in 2004. One of the conclusions in this analysis is that “The A1 accident rate of the road sections with a higher speed limit is indeed greater than that of the road sections whose speed limit is not adjusted (A1 is defined as ‘the traffic accidents that cause people to die on the scene or within twenty-four hours.’).” In other words, whether to cancel the speed limit for the inner lanes or raise the speed limit for the middle lanes remains to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 Concerning the above information and consideration, the Public Digital Innovation Office (PDIS) of the Executive Yuan, which is my office, and the two responsible units, that is, the NHPB and the Freeway Bureau (FB), convened a collaboration meeting on March 6th to discuss the core issue of “How to give priority to the inner lanes for vehicle overtaking and allow vehicles to run at the highest speed limit under normal traffic to improve the freeway traffic flow and the safety of users?” Interested parties were invited to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 The meeting was successful. First, participants could further explore and promote the rationality of the policy according to which the inner lanes on the freeways are the passing lanes. Second, it urged the FB to release more statistical data that can serve as a reference for the NHPB to ramp up its technology-based law enforcement and increase the efficiency of the police force distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">How to improve the freeway traffic flow and the safety of users?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/862bc67b532ae87d4dc5f67bda6a93e99864d0a3.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/862bc67b532ae87d4dc5f67bda6a93e99864d0a3.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Design Notes: eMask 2.0</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8F%A3%E7%BD%A9%E5%AF%A6%E5%90%8D%E5%88%B6%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E6%AC%8A%E8%A1%A1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design Notes: eMask 2.0" /><published>2020-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8F%A3%E7%BD%A9%E5%AF%A6%E5%90%8D%E5%88%B6%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E6%AC%8A%E8%A1%A1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8F%A3%E7%BD%A9%E5%AF%A6%E5%90%8D%E5%88%B6%E7%9A%84%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E6%AC%8A%E8%A1%A1/">&lt;p&gt;🆕 The Executive Yuan has officially launched “eMask 2.0” for preordering masks online, while keeping the current mask distribution systems in pharmacies participating in National Health Insurance. The main purpose of this is, on the one hand, to provide an alternative for people who are having difficulties purchasing masks at pharmacies, due to factors such as time and distance. On the other hand, it is also hoped that this system will ease the tides of people queuing at pharmacies, and solve the shortage of masks in certain areas, thereby increasing the distribution efficiency and usage ratio of masks. Of course, there is room for improvement in any policy, and in the following, we will share with our readers the various policy trade-offs made by the team over the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💻 Firstly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://emask.taiwan.gov.tw&quot;&gt;preorder website for eMask 2.0&lt;/a&gt; was revised from the Ministry of Finance’s tax declaration software, which was chosen for qualities such as the stability of its system, and also because it could go online immediately. However, the system needs to be used with a matching card reader, in order to read NHI cards and Citizen Digital Certificates, but this only works on computers, putting cell phone users at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 With this in mind, the government decided to connect eMask 2.0 to the “NHI Quick and Easy Healthcare” mobile app, and greatly expanded the traffic of the front end and back end systems in order to respond to real demand. In this way, the majority of Taiwanese people will have the same opportunities to use eMask 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📦 Second, various options for the distribution details of eMask 2.0 were discussed, such as 3 masks per person per week, or 6 masks per person every 2 weeks, which is the system currently used by pharmacies, or a one-time allocation of 50 masks. Based on the considerations made by public health professionals, however, the government eventually decided to make the eMask 2.0 system follow the same pattern of pharmacies, in distributing a maximum of 3 masks per person per week, in order to allow as many people as possible to obtain the basic amount of masks required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Thirdly, according to our calculations, the number of masks that can be used for the first round of distribution through eMask 2.0 is approximately 7 million. Calculating for 3 masks per set, it equates to 2.33 million people. In other words, if more than 2.33 million people preorder masks, then there must be an impartial way of determining who will be eligible to collect the masks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🆔 Therefore, the team decided that when necessary, a collection list will be generated using a public lottery system. For example, the last digit of the ID card numbers provided by each person will act as an impartial method of identification. Those whose numbers were drawn will each receive an email with a collection number from a designated convenience store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎲 The focus here is that the software system will use random numbers to automatically generate the collection list, which in terms of technology, satisfies requirements for fairness. However, it might not be able to meet the high level of social demands for transparency. In comparison, public lottery, while rather primitive, is actually more trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ℹ️ Finally, the preorder website uses a registration system instead of a “first come, first served” queuing system. By this, we hope lower the pressure on the system, so that those few people with the ability to write ticket snatching computer programs would not crowd out the rights of other people.
p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Postscript: Since April 9th, each set has been changed to 14 pieces for two weeks. No lottery has been needed so far, and all pre-orders have been successful.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">Under the condition that the existing health insurance special pharmacy distribution system remains unchanged, new online pre-order channels have been added.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3dd0ee36ff7ff6447ab517fb5a5d775c2c258f10.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3dd0ee36ff7ff6447ab517fb5a5d775c2c258f10.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dr.Message counters disinformation</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E9%98%B2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E4%B9%9F%E8%A6%81%E6%B2%BB%E8%AC%A0%E8%A8%80/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dr.Message counters disinformation" /><published>2020-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E9%98%B2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E4%B9%9F%E8%A6%81%E6%B2%BB%E8%AC%A0%E8%A8%80</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E9%98%B2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E4%B9%9F%E8%A6%81%E6%B2%BB%E8%AC%A0%E8%A8%80/">&lt;p&gt;💊 Recently, the world is paying the most attention to developments in the epidemic situation. From medical care to public health policy, it has been the subject of much attention. With the people of Taiwan working for a common goal, we have made preliminary results in controlling the spread of the virus, but false information that endangers the epidemic prevention efforts has become a serious issue facing many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 The good news is that Taiwan’s efforts to prevent the harmful effects of false information have once again attracted the attention of international partners. At the end of February, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the US State Department’s Global Engagement Center, Park Advisors, along with the Institute for Information Technology, have co-hosted the “US-Taiwan Tech Challenge” for the first time. The “Dr. Message” chatbot, developed by TrendMicro engineers won first prize, standing out in a field of teams that included Israel and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The ‘birth’ of Dr.Message arose from Liu Yanbo and several engineer colleagues at TrendMicro, all of whom had been affected by fake news and texts. After a group discussion, they decided to spend time after work developing their own fraud prevention and anti-fake news tools. Users just need to add the Dr.Message LINE account as a friend and forwards suspicious messages to it, the bot will verify whether it is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖼️ The team then discovered that many of the fake messages systematically appeared in fraudulent groups, and then decided to expand the service to identify false messages. In order to respond to various types of fraudulent and false information, Dr.Message can not only detect the text, but also identify information such as stickers or links, and even supports group identification. After adding the account to the group, Dr.Message can view the group Links and messages inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 In addition to contacting non-governmental organizations such as “Cofacts” and “MyGoPen”, Dr.Message also cooperates with government agencies. At present, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, and the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the National Police Agency and four other agencies continue to provide structured information for verification. So far, Dr.Message has over 300,000 users. In the past month alone, they have read more than 45 million pieces of information, successfully responded to over one million messages with false or fraudulent information, and a Facebook version of the chatbot is expected to launch in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 A platform for clarification that allows information to be verified by integrating various parties’ databases also echoes the US-Taiwan Tech Challenge’s original intentions: proposing innovative technological solutions through cross-sector and cross-platform public collaboration to solve current social issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 In the end, the epidemic will pass. In the process, the mutual trust and friendship that has built up from all walks of life, as well as the benefits of openness, mutual trust, and working together, are the lessons given to me from Dr.Message, and they are a good remedy to deal with those methods that would split us apart.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Add its LINE account as a friend and forwards suspicious messages to it, and the bot will verify whether it is false.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/016210424bb02ab250b184c71c1a21671bc4b5a8_2_1380x920.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/016210424bb02ab250b184c71c1a21671bc4b5a8_2_1380x920.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New PO reports for duty</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%86-PO-%E5%A0%B1%E5%88%B0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New PO reports for duty" /><published>2020-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%86-PO-%E5%A0%B1%E5%88%B0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%86-PO-%E5%A0%B1%E5%88%B0/">&lt;p&gt;🙋 PO is an abbreviation of “Participation Officer (PO)” of the Inter-Ministerial Council of the Executive Yuan. Just like the “Congressional Liaison” responsible for coordinating with legislators, the “Media Contact” is responsible for communicating with the media. According to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://po.pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/&quot;&gt;Directions for Implementing the Role of Participation Officers in the Executive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 “During the policy formulation and promotion process, each government agency shall give full consideration to transparency, participation, accountability, inclusion and other basic principles of open government. If complex stakeholder relationships, multiple differences of opinion or issues of intense public participation are involved, the PO shall assist the head of the agency concerned to assess in the initial stage of policy planning whether the agency should adopt an appropriate process upholding the principle of open government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 To put it simply, the PO’s core function is to act as a bridge of communication between the government and the people through an open multi-stakeholder model. This also raises the biggest challenge because “open” means that the communication mode must be tailored to each case and cannot be restricted to a single method; whereas “multi-stakeholder” means that it is quite difficult to integrate and balance the opinions. Therefore, the biggest challenge of being a PO is working out how to design a sound mechanism to ensure that all parties listen to each other calmly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📅 According to rules of the “Directions”, each ministry “shall designate at least one person of appropriate rank and full authorization to act as PO”. For this reason, since 2017, the beginning of each year has also been the time when a new PO reports for duty (whether the term is initial or renewed). Furthermore, with the expansion and deepening of the work of open government, more and more level three subordinate agencies of the ministries are also assigning special personnel to serve as POs. After all, when discussing multiple issues, having the division, department, bureau and station levels serve as windows can better reach the key points and shorten the communication process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ This year’s new PO has another task that is different from that of the past, namely, to assist its relevant ministry in planning the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndc.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=0C5AB1D0FA5B64B8&amp;amp;upn=97AD5AA9359CAB38&quot;&gt;National Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;” (NAP) of Open Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👩‍🏫 Under the leadership of Chen Mei-ling, Chairperson of the National Development Council, various ministries have taken stock of the five major issues of “maximizing open data value-added applications”, “expanding public participation in public policy mechanisms”, “increasing dialogue on gender and ethnic inclusion”, “implementing clean governance” and “implementing money laundering prevention”, and have invited public consultation on the “Join Public Speaking” platform. This demonstrates the determination for the continual promotion of open government and the will to actively participate in the international organization, Open Government Partnership (OGP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 Of course, the focus of opening up the government does not end with a unilateral commitment from the government. It also involves dialogue, mutual trust and cooperation between the government and the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👣 It is more important for the government and the people to take one step forward together rather than for either side to take two steps forward on their own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">It is more important for the government and the people to move forward together than to make two separate steps on either side.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dc785f09fe2ae0b5b49e8a4efcbb870737b435b0_2_1380x500.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dc785f09fe2ae0b5b49e8a4efcbb870737b435b0_2_1380x500.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to use design thinking to design government digital services?</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E9%81%8B%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83%E9%80%B2%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%9A%84%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to use design thinking to design government digital services?" /><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E9%81%8B%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83%E9%80%B2%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%9A%84%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%3F</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E9%81%8B%E7%94%A8%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83%E9%80%B2%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%9A%84%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; 
&lt;img width=&quot;768&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c64fb3a045ed6428c29151a1ef04c9ef158172e7.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing through the bamboo forest, which is rich in water and higher than humans, the rugged sharp ridges unfold in front. The uninhabited alpine grasslands and continuous peaks are pure land with many primitive ecology, and also the exploration of the foot of many mountain enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a mountain scene that covers 70% of Taiwan's total land area. On this small island in Taiwan, there are more than 200 high mountains over 3,000 meters. Most of them need to apply for approval before they can enter the mountain. However, application services are scattered in pages designed independently by each administration, regardless of user experience or rules. Experienced mountaineering users often need to compare the private mountaineering information network and netizens' routes beforehand, and then open the application page one by one. Behind these skilful moves, the complexity of the mountaineering management mechanism is highlighted. For ordinary people who want to get close to the mountain forest, these application processes are even more difficult!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early August, the Ministry of the Interior proposed at the Open Government Liaisons Monthly Meeting that the case be brought to the Executive Digital's Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS) for collaboration. Since then, PDIS and various ministries have conducted a redesign of the &quot;Taiwan Mountaineering One-stop Integrated Service Network&quot; based on design thinking for a period of about four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the monthly meeting, PDIS and the various ministries will take stock of the current situation to clarify existing challenges and design practices to promote the entire project. We take stock of the three biggest challenges in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The short-term one-stop solution is to provide an entrance link, causing a rebound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The interface, rules, and user experience are inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The existing services are government-oriented and lack user-oriented thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-2019630-the-architectural-services-department-tried-to-unify-the-entrance-but-it-actually-only-provided-multiple-entrances-link-causing-the-public-to-rebound&quot;&gt;1. 2019/6/30 The Architectural Services Department tried to unify the entrance, but it actually only provided multiple entrances Link, causing the public to rebound.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; Below this picture are the diagrams of the application entrances. After clicking, the web page will lead the user to their respective pages to apply. There is no unified entrance, which will cause Shanyou to rebound. &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; Mountaineering applications have been around for many years, and each ministry will make its own rules and design entrances, resulting in inconsistent interfaces and specifications, and applicants are often confused. &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-existing-services-are-government-oriented-and-lack-user-oriented-thinking&quot;&gt;3. The existing services are government-oriented and lack user-oriented thinking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; The specifications highlighted in the figure with various colors, font sizes, and different colors of background colors again show that the ministry will not consider &amp;quot;user experience&amp;quot; as the guide when designing this service, but use &amp;quot;government standards&amp;quot; as the guide. Thinking &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-step-to-the-challenge&quot;&gt;The first step to the challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/88232f207584ffec81979a38770eadeae1582870.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; At the beginning of the project, there were many challenges and difficulties, and it was always a mess. Using the double diamond design to think about divergence and convergence, we can put together a more systematic process. &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the overall challenge, we have cited Double Diamond in design thinking as the flow of our project. Of course, user interviews commonly used in design thinking, defining core issues, and user testing are all There is progress. And this time we quoted the spirit of collaboration in open government and arranged two workshops and a digital dialogue. The following will briefly introduce these three important links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91621552e253a83ef26b3d6652cb400851c6e9a5.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; In addition to the methods described above, we used a collaborative approach to arrange two workshops and a digital dialogue to collect opinions and jointly design government services with relevant stakeholders. &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-201996-collaboration-meeting&quot;&gt;1. 2019/9/6 Collaboration Meeting&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the project, we invited all stakeholders related to mountaineering to participate in a collaboration meeting. This is the first time that everyone has discussed this issue face to face, and there is still a long way to go in the future, so everyone's first impression is very important. Therefore, in the meeting, in addition to helping everyone unify the issues, PDIS also designed group discussions to allow everyone to exchange their experiences, difficulties or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called three-point meeting, in the group discussion, sharing of experience can build mutual trust and empathy. In addition, PDIS often hears a solution proposed by one party in the discussion, and some people may raise difficulties or challenges in implementation. However, the diverse composition encourages everyone to think in another way. Often, they can come up with solutions to the difficulties and help in the discussion. Promote ideas that weren't feasible, or find eclectic alternatives that everyone can accept or implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class=&quot;hike-img-note&quot;&gt; On the day of the collaboration meeting, we invited interested parties to participate in the discussion (the picture shows the representative of the Forestry Bureau, the representative of the national park, the search and rescue personnel, the mountain friend, the mountain guide, the mountain tourism practitioners and the open government contact person), and the PDIS Collaborate on the core issues of the design to find the corresponding solution. &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-20199--2-9--30-polis-digital-dialogue&quot;&gt;2. 2019/9 / 2-9 / 30 Polis Digital Dialogue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have used a digital tool Polis, hoping to collect people who care about this issue in a short time opinion. The advantage of Polis is that it can collect people's opinions widely at low cost, without space or number of people. More importantly, there is a consent and disagree function on the interface. In addition to expressing their views, everyone can agree or disagree with the views put forward by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we used the public speaking platform of the National Development Council to conduct a one-month Polis digital dialogue. A total of 813 people participated in the vote, cast 12,393 votes, and collected 121 views on digital platform transformation. Such results can not only collect opinions widely, but also carry out classified calculations based on whether or not the users agree, so that colleagues in the public sector can more accurately grasp public opinion, and at the same time do not miss any ideas and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/694c60d0bff1a946225fcc30a93fb0e6b51746ef.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-20191031-testing-the-climbing-forum-before-going-live&quot;&gt;3. 2019/10/31 Testing the climbing forum before going live&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to expect the beta test version to be launched on 11/1, we have arranged a climbing forum on 10/31 In addition to hoping to find stakeholders to share the project progress and challenges, this forum is very important to look forward to management. I hope these participants can understand that the version to be launched tomorrow is a beta version and work together to make this digital service better. Soon after the forum ended, we actually saw many participants sharing in their community, actively promoting the launch of tomorrow ’s test, and encouraging everyone to provide more suggestions. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e4e3dbe0e195af5cef6a1424feb290c4ad08be4c.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;design-test-instead-of-the-previous-online--completed&quot;&gt;&quot;Design-test&quot; instead of the previous &quot;online = completed&quot;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the method just mentioned In addition, we also used prototyping in design thinking in our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the digital services provided by many governments, the thinking of “going online = done” is still there. However, digital services and user experience are a process of continuous updating and iteration. Therefore, we hope to replace the previous &quot;online = completion&quot; thinking with a repetitive iteration of &quot;design-test&quot; in this project. (Launch = complete mindset to Build-test-repeat phiolosophy) For this reason, we listed this practice as a prerequisite in the process of finding a manufacturer. In the later implementation process, manufacturers cooperated with testing and public feedback to release a new version in two to three days to two or three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/1/189732cf3afb08e02cf47ed7a14d96b70e942c76.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;openapi-opens-another-possibility-for-design-thinking&quot;&gt;OpenAPI opens another possibility for design thinking&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another implementation requirement is the Open API Specification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-information people, the term may be strange. Explained by my (designer) understanding, the Open API is like a language for communication between software and software, which unifies this communication language. In the future, when folks want to use this government service to design their own software, they can follow these Specification to open the possibility of this service. These applications may be useful in familiar navigation, search and rescue. It can also extend the functionality of this digital service in our unknown domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the design of the double rhombus, we introduced the Open API to open the tail of the double rhombus, so that a government service that was originally purely functional could become a carrier of various private digital services. The original &quot;Deliver&quot; in the last stage became &quot;Unlock&quot;. Let the digital services provided by this government continue to expand the scope of its services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c4b362d3c9082d944915e538a0a5764b7d63fab6.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ray-30-design-introduction&quot;&gt;Ray 3.0 design introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made many different attempts in this project. In the summer of 2019, we We invited young people who are very interested in public affairs to select different digital services in the government for user research and redesign. (We call it Rescue Action by Youth.) Many of them are studying design-related departments, or college students or graduate students who are very interested in user experience and service design. One group of students chose the entry system to study in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning that the mountaineering system was about to be redesigned through design methods in early September, we invited them to join us with the research results of the user for a month. In the process of user testing in these months, thanks to this group of future designers who have conducted an in-depth investigation of this service for a month, we have received a lot of excitement and assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-interviews-and-tests-conducted-by-the-public-sector&quot;&gt;User interviews and tests conducted by the public sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues in the Construction Department and the Forest Service who are not familiar with design thinking and collaboration have also spent a lot in this project. Time for user interviews and tests. The skills of writing interviews and interviews are also becoming more and more proficient in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDIS has led the public sector to open government projects for many times. In addition to assisting everyone, I also wrote a short walk to interview and interview. I look forward to providing it to my colleagues in the public sector who work with us every time. I also welcome folks to share references and even give feedback, so that user experience and design thinking can continue to affect everyone in every corner of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-say&quot;&gt;What do you say&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observed the comments of mountain friends on the Internet who care about this system and found some subtle changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the scolding of the original system by everyone on 6/30 to the test of the integration service, we saw that netizens shifted their attention from scolding to suggestions. Everyone likes to say that netizens are sour people, but we found that as long as there is a channel willing to listen to suggestions, everyone's opinions will become more constructive. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/ddcaf2ea43c0bfa705732a8488755c19e2199525.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we also saw some participating people who took the initiative to share their own experience in participating in design and construction. In addition to helping the digital service to explain some of the restrictions that have just been launched, they are also very proud to share and participate. process. Discuss and participate in the design together, so that the original service user has also become a co-creator. This hope for a better sense of responsibility for this service has also sprouted in the hearts of the participants. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ee41bbb8091286106327c5b507ba8147312f359d.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message from a mountain friend: &quot;This site is still a long way off from what we imagined, but I still feel relieved and at least started to go.&quot; In fact, the process of this project is like mountain climbing. Difficult, needs the help of teammates, and everyone's efforts, at least we started to move forward, the results and beauty are ahead, let us work together! 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/03ff6e3d20ab08e80158eba0888d91f72bfa50c7.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-follow-up&quot;&gt;Project follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four-month project continued to improve after the 11/1 Beta test went live. 
PDIS is also returned to the Construction Department for construction after the aging of the temporary project, and new versions of improvements and optimizations are currently being released. We also welcome friends who are interested in the one-stop service network for Taiwan mountaineering applications, to provide suggestions and feedback at any time.

&lt;p&gt;Since June 2019, under the leadership of President Su Zhenchang, the Executive Yuan has launched the &quot;open mountain forest&quot; policy, and the Construction Department has also launched &quot;Taiwan Mountaineering Application Integration Information&quot; on June 30 &quot;Net&quot;, as the beginning of the forest policy, aims to make it easier for people to apply for entry to the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After integrating the information online, many suggestions flooded into the website. As a rare cross-ministerial information integration website in recent years, integrating the information network is the first step. The opinions of the people let colleagues in various ministries understand the possible directions for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Wang Junkai, the open government contact person of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PO&quot;), proposed this case in the &quot;Open Government Contact Person Work Promotion Conference&quot; (&quot;PO monthly meeting&quot;) in August to collaborate with PDIS to transform User experience for the online climbing application process. Under the authorization of Dean Su, PDIS cuts through the technical aspects of system integration and assists in the incurability of inter-ministerial system-to-system interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a month of planning and discussion, we held a collaborative meeting on September 6 to work together with Shanyou to design and plan a new online application process in the form of a workshop. The final result is the current Taiwan Mountaineering Application Integration Information Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-the-user-and-find-the-pain-points&quot;&gt;Focus on the user and find the pain points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Existing application process&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/639100831491b86eeb2ef0db5ba783d027e0f39f_2_991x558.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 1. Existing application process. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the existing application process, the public needs to take more care to identify the management unit involved in the route they are walking and apply separately. For those who want to get close to the forest, but are relatively inexperienced, it is a bit of a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government Digital Service Guidelines (Note 1), the first &quot;** Understanding user needs **&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**Define who is the user of the service (including the digitally disadvantaged). Through continuous user research, design services that meet user needs. **&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;**In order to design (digital) services that meet users 'real needs and make them happy to use, users (including multiple stakeholders) must be defined, and services must be integrated into users' lives and Need rather than just the services that users or providers want, consider the digitally vulnerable channels that need help, and continue to explore demand for sophisticated services with users. **&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we collected the opinions of the people through a variety of ways, and looked for pain points from the perspective of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;college-student-interactive-service-designers-participate-together&quot;&gt;College student interactive service designers participate together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, PDIS has been cooperating with the Youth Department Public Development Department's &quot;Public College Student Department Trainee Program&quot; to implement &quot; Young Students Medical Examination Government Website Plan (referred to as RAY). &quot; Youth are invited to participate in public affairs by improving government digital services. Beginning in 2019, it is different from the large-scale medical examinations for the compatibility of government websites in the previous two years. Instead, we invite college students who specialize in human-computer interaction and service design to carry out in-depth design and transformation of digital service processes for government websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One group of RAY trainees chose to improve the online climbing application process as the trainee content. After simple interviews and surveys, they described Persona of the mountain friends, defined the appearance of the target users of the system, and set key tasks to find subjects who met the appearance. Interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students then summarized the opinions collected in the interview and incorporated them into the prototype design. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/website_wireframe&quot;&gt;Use Low-Fidelity Prototype (Wireframe)&lt;/a&gt; invites interviewees to test the newly designed interface and evaluate its benefits by using service process design methods. after many iterations, the students of the ray project eventually produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mockup&quot;&gt;mockup of the system interface&lt;/a&gt;, as a reference for the subsequent system development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/88dfc925a04f11d60c705fb4b5454df314b8b46b_2_991x565.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 2. System prototype produced by the RAY project. The picture is the homepage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://xd.adobe.com/view/d99a87d9-9e9d-45bb-6bc7-e72798977083-afab/?fullscreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; There is a Demo webpage that can interact online &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-integrating-information-systems-across-departments&quot;&gt;The challenge of integrating information systems across departments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a one-stop mountaineering application service, the immediate challenge was that entering the forest under the current regulations may involve the jurisdiction of many business units And brought many sub-topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious challenge is to create a new process interface after integrating the application processes in almost nothing. Fortunately, in this part, we already have Mockups made by trainees of RAY. Based on this, we incorporated the opinions collected in the collaborative meeting and fine-tuned them, and we have a pretty good interface design draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/23f9335c6f4746f0468eeb707164f772cacde086_2_615x750.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 3. Prototype of the adjusted system interface &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend with experience in product system analysis must know that the integration and optimization of the process interface is only the first step in the integration of multiple systems. The most difficult thing is to integrate the system operation logic that is hidden behind the operation interface, but is not easy for users to discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to environmental protection and sustainable development, some mountains and forests in Taiwan have been designated as national parks or nature reserves. People must apply to the National Park Office or Forestry Bureau before entering to facilitate environmental load control. Further sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Taiwan's mountainous areas were listed as controlled areas. According to Article 5 of the National Security Law, applications should be made to the authorities before entering the mountainous area. Although the banned area is being lifted gradually, the public must apply to the police station (the current executive authority of the mountain forest control area) to enter the mountainous area before entering the unbanned area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of integration is greatly increased when there may be more than one and not exactly the same administrative authority in each location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7c7bfcd6ca6d84aa154de35db7540000a208c573_2_991x693.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 4. PDIS self-examined the regular mental map during the project. The rules in the picture are not necessarily the actual rules on the line, but the rules of the present moment. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see from the above figure that there are differences in the number of application days, the number of members (membership types), and even the way of drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences between these rules include the considerations of the administrative operation process of each management unit. As far as the system design is concerned, it is certainly better to unify these rules as much as possible. However, under the consideration of time pressure, there is not enough time for various administrative departments to sit down and unify the rules. Therefore, being able to handle complex application rules has become one of the major considerations of the system design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-we-integrate&quot;&gt;So how do we integrate?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/4/43da67ffe01266585740d588f330ab41a29f6645.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 5. Mind map for system design considerations. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after a comprehensive system inventory, a huge tree diagram like the one above is generated. There are many things to be solved, but resources and time are limited. Therefore, the first task is to find the core and key from many requirements. Part of the implementation, and set the goal of the system on November 1st; this approach is also known as the industry's MVP minimum viable product (minimum viable product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-strategy&quot;&gt;Our Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We split the one-stop service website into two parts, Frontend and Backend (Note 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to plan out the range of the smallest viable product, we try to imitate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/microservice&quot;&gt;microservice&lt;/a&gt; thinking common in the general industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;** What is microservice thinking? **&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*If you try to imagine a one-stop system as a castle made of bricks, we can simply divide the castle into many different shapes. Building blocks, just find out the building blocks of the required shape one by one for assembly. If a specific shape does not exist, make it; and to avoid spending time and money making new blocks, cut the castle with the existing shape as much as possible as a priority. * 
*At the same time, remember that when stacking wooden blocks in the past, they were usually made into the most common shape (such as round, square, triangle, etc.), so if you have to make new blocks as a last resort, consider as much as possible. Cut into a universal shape. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e1ddb1d3f4f5c8f387edc9518b9714e7d47986ca_2_991x496.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 6. Through the thinking of stacked wood, PDIS initially conceived the prototype of Figure 6. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important points in the thinking of stacked blocks is to avoid making new blocks as much as possible, so we choose to keep the existing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the right half of the figure, the main core part of this one-stop service is the new building blocks. Frontend-&quot;One-stop Application User Interface&quot; and Backend-&quot;One-stop Application Server&quot; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle is the part where every existing building block is connected with one-stop service-&quot;User Agent&quot;, which can be imagined as making a new and old building block adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this structure, the existing system can be retained, and a one-stop integrated service network can be developed, allowing the one-stop integrated service network to throw back application data to the original system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RESTful API is used for the connection between the new system and the agent. The API specification is adopted by the National Development Commission based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oai/openapi-specification/blob/master/v ㄐ ersions / 3.0.0.md&quot;&gt;OAS3&lt;/a&gt; (openapi specification 3.0) &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theme.ndc.gov.tw/lawout/lawcontent.aspx?id=gl000270&quot;&gt;common application programming interface specification&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 08/28 and 09/06, under the auspices of Tang Feng, held a total of two technical meetings with the ministry and related manufacturers to discuss the aforementioned prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first technical meeting of 08/28, PDIS first proposed the concept as shown in Figure 6 to the ministry and manufacturers. Solicit opinions from various manufacturers and communicate matters that existing manufacturers need to cooperate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second technical meeting of 09/06, at this time, the technical details of the &quot;user agent&quot; were discussed. There are roughly two directions: the existing vendors implement APIs on existing systems, And other contract manufacturers make APIs through web crawler technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0564f8a4c6ea5ff354ec1049f1146a9f493cbff3_2_991x558.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 7 shows the system architecture of a one-stop service network (compared to Figure 6, simplifying the existing system and using agents) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After user interviews by RAY students, two technical meetings, and the morning technical meeting of the second technical meeting, a total of more than one month, we produced the minimum feasible model shown in Figure 7. Implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the National Park Admission by the Police Department, Forest Service, and Architectural Administration for existing national parks, the entry of the Police Department into the mountains, the Forest Service Bureau's protected areas, and the mountain house system are implemented in accordance with the National Development Commission based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oai/openapi-specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md&quot;&gt;OAS3 &lt;/a&gt; (openapi specification 3.0) &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https: // theme .ndc.gov.tw / lawout / lawcontent.aspx? id = gl000270&quot;&gt;common application programming interface specification&lt;/a&gt; &quot;, so that the original system manufacturers can, as far as possible, target &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki&quot;&gt;crud&lt;/a&gt; / create, read, update, delete) and public information review (such as load limit, balance) implement an application programming interface (api) for one-stop website use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grasp-the-spirit-of-government-digital-service-guidelines-note-1&quot;&gt;Grasp the spirit of government digital service guidelines (Note 1)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist various agencies within the government to develop cross-domain service integration and implement user-centered service design concepts, to achieve the vision of building a smart government, Under the leadership of the National Development Commission in January 107, the “Guidelines for the Design of Government Digital Services (Draft)” were drafted, and the Government Digital Services Guidelines (Beta) were published in October of the same year, which were provided to agencies for the development of digital services. reference. (Note 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one-stop climbing application service is no exception. We take into account the overall development energy as much as possible to (Note 1). From time to time throughout the execution of the project, I checked back from time to time to see if it deviated from its spirit, as one of the basis for adjustment during the execution of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Development Commission-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndc.gov.tw/content_list.aspx?n=e7f6c261a5f5d9f5&quot;&gt;Government Digital Services Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iterative-evolution-of-government-departments-is-also-possible&quot;&gt;Iterative evolution of government departments is also possible!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned mentioned guidelines for grasping government digital services, the fourth of which is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** ** Continuously Improved Operational Procedures ** 
Through Rapid Prototyping, Iterative, and Incremental Software development methods, continuous improvement services. 
In order to respond to technological innovation, policy challenges, and changes in user needs, it is appropriate to consider the changes in user needs, the overall structure of the service, and the maturity of technical resources at all stages of the service life cycle. Iterative development procedures are adopted and continuously included. Give feedback and respond quickly to advanced services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this one-stop integrated development process, we tried to follow this spirit, and imitate the industry's software engineering method to request contracted developers to make iterative corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/01, less than a month after the start of the 09/09 development work, we conducted the first internal user test of the system still under development, and invited those who had participated in the collaborative meeting Civil partners assist in testing, point out problems, and collect and summarize these problems for contract manufacturers to modify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lapse of half a month, 10/16 re-invited the civil partners who participated in the previous test to confirm whether there have been improvements to the questions raised previously, and at the same time to discuss those features that may be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the coordination of the Ministry of Education, each subsystem (microservice) on the integrated system has a &quot;test environment&quot; and a &quot;formal environment&quot;. After the 11/01 system was launched, there were two sets of similar system environments. On the basis, through the cycle shown in Figure 8, the system can be gradually made better step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3b7df857a6584c7f5f0b2dfa8b7a1e67fb738d7e_2_991x558.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Figure 8. Iterative loop &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;大事记&quot;&gt;大事记&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, in line with the requirements of the policy schedule, we launched the first version of the integrated system in the development schedule only about two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of the picture below helped you organize the beginning and end of this case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not the end … we are about to start&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the system was released on November 1, this is not the end, it is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, this case uses iterative development, so after the system goes online, it will continue to consolidate opinions and include continuous revision considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those matters that are limited by the time-course pressure and excluded from the minimum feasible model, PDIS also sorted it out for reference at the follow-up refinement meeting on December 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 2: If the general industry defines web services similarly, the front-end Frontend is the web interface that the user can operate; the back-end Backend is the part that the user cannot see on the web server. Taking this case as an example, the design of the RAY students is the front-end design draft; the back part is the part that helps to throw the application form back to the original system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>莊秉倫</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="開放政府" /><category term="登山申請一站式服務網" /><category term="青年參與" /><category term="協作" /><category term="工作坊" /><category term="公私協力" /><summary type="html">From the perspective of information technology, the construction process of one-stop service network for mountaineering applications</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6c5b2ed839a246bd50f1839f2c5a71c2a5e4526.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6c5b2ed839a246bd50f1839f2c5a71c2a5e4526.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">One-stop service system for mountaineering application</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/%E7%82%BA%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%89%93%E9%80%A0%E4%B8%80%E7%AB%99%E5%BC%8F%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One-stop service system for mountaineering application" /><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/%E7%82%BA%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%89%93%E9%80%A0%E4%B8%80%E7%AB%99%E5%BC%8F%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/%E7%82%BA%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%89%93%E9%80%A0%E4%B8%80%E7%AB%99%E5%BC%8F%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story-begins-here&quot;&gt;The story begins here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in 2019, the famous celebrity in the mountain world, Brother G (Wu Jiyun), rushed down the mountain trail of Wushuangshe in Penjushan, triggering heated discussions in the mountaineering community. Six million people engage in mountaineering activities, and really deal with the problem, not the person who has the problem. Therefore, Zhang Jingsen, an administrative member who is also a senior mountain friend, coordinated the relevant agencies and started dialogues with mountaineering groups. After gradually establishing mutual trust, an open mountain forest policy was established with the core concepts of simple administration, convenient information, and shared risk management. 
This kind of policy change has begun to make everyone think that related mechanisms or laws should not only meet the needs of regulators, but also take into account the needs of users. The first step into the mountain forest-mountaineering application, was soon noticed: national park admission application, police station entry application, forestry bureau mountain house and nature reserve application, there are four independent systems, although the competent authorities are different 2. Jurisdiction of affairs has different natural results, but why not integrate them together? 
The competent authority responded immediately and launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mountain.cpami.gov.tw/&quot;&gt;“Taiwan Mountaineering Application Integration Information Network”&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies, it is to integrate information about various systems related to existing mountaineering applications on the same webpage. However, it is still clear that Yangguan Road and the wooden bridge still have to go separately. Of course, this does not meet the expectations of Shanyou. Everyone wants a one-stop application that can go all the way. Through the open government contact mechanism, PDIS cooperated with relevant authorities to open a one-stop service for creating mountaineering online applications. Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;must-race-against-time&quot;&gt;Must race against time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First challenge, like the disaster prevention information system or vegetable price information system that PDIS has worked on, the one-stop service system for mountaineering cannot start a new stove and must change clothes, regardless of whether It is an application for admission to the three national parks, an application for entry to the mountains of the Police Department, and even an application for the mountain house of the Forestry Bureau. They must provide services 24 hours a day, without interruption. Moreover, if a new road is opened, unless the original website is closed, It is difficult to change the original user from abandoning the old one, and such a “shock therapy” will not be the first choice for service design. Therefore, PDIS still adopts the approach of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/zh-TW/project/emic/&quot;&gt;“consistent front desk and integrated back office” in the previous projects&lt;/a&gt;. 
However, unlike the previous “Information” system projects, the mountaineering application system is not a one-way interception of information release, but must be able to accept the people’s application for landing and respond in both directions. It is conceivable how technically, the existing system and one-stop platform interface; on the administrative side, from the completion of the procurement process to the consistency of the application rules, there are all kinds of incurable diseases, which require three competent authorities to step out The same dance steps. PDIS therefore convened a series of meetings, and invited the relevant administrative and information personnel (vendors) to discuss together, including the Tang Feng administrative committee member who also personally collaborated with you at multiple technical meetings. 
In September, the Executive Yuan fully launched the policy inventory of open forests, and the one-stop service website was also included as a part of specific policy measures, so there is even more pressure to delay time: the new system will be available online on November 1 service. This means that in less than a month, a new front-end and back-end service interface will be produced, and a closed user test will be conducted. Then, a “public test” will be launched. There is probably nothing more to call the development of government information systems. Quick deployment. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeking-better-but-imperfect&quot;&gt;Seeking better but imperfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For PDIS, open government is still the core idea that runs through the entire project, which means that user-centeredness is the only thing here, except for collaborations The meeting allowed multi-stakeholders to focus on issues, and service design optimization must also be accompanied by every step of system development. In particular, the new and old systems coexist after the launch, and the user experience must be at least equal or better. Otherwise, the new system will inevitably be left unattended. Originally, the application rules of the three sets of individual systems were overlapping or inconsistent. The formula becomes the same path, the defects are immediately enlarged, and the user’s expectations for the simplification of the program will increase. 
However, several main government agencies are promoting the policy of opening up the forest and forestry. The business burden is already extremely heavy, and it is difficult to take care of it. Due to the fate, PDIS has carried out the “Young Student Physical Examination Government Website Service Project” for the third year (RAY 3.0), the theme is exactly the optimization of government website service design. RAY’s team, under the leadership of PDIS designers, has joined the ranks of mountaineering one-stop service transformation. 
But don’t get me wrong. Although this project combines the experience and resources accumulated by PDIS in recent years, and is the integration and advanced of the existing mountaineering application system, it will not be, and PDIS does not intend to treat it as the ultimate perfect solution, regardless of the possibility of future improvement. Sexuality, or non-governmental participation and adaptation, are open-minded, so from the beginning, they must meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theme.ndc.gov.tw/lawout/LawContent.aspx?id=GL000270&quot;&gt;“Common Application Interface Specification” of the National Development Commission&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the end of this project does not represent the end of the transformation of the mountaineering application service system, but the beginning of forward and outward extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-big-lies-in-the-mountaineering-world&quot;&gt;Three big lies in the mountaineering world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know how this project came to pass, although PDIS adheres to the principle of open government transparency, it must leave records on the Internet and make it public, but latecomers must hope that those who actually pass by can Combining personal observations and feelings, share some “footnotes.” The two soul figures involved in this project, Zhuang Binglun, an information engineer, and Zhang Haoting, a service designer, wrote different first-hand observations and wonderful “hiking notes” from different perspectives. 
There are three big lies in the mountaineering industry. Before the departure, I told you “it’s very simple”, I always said “coming soon” along the way, and claimed that I would never come again! From the start to the end of this project, at least the first two lies should be the driving force to support all participating working partners and their PDIS colleagues. 
As for coming again? In this project, the PDIS and the mountaineering authority can be said to have performed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndc.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=E7F6C261A5F5D9F5&quot;&gt;“Government Digital Service Guidelines”&lt;/a&gt; issued by the National Development Commission, naturally looking forward to As a leading case, there is a practical reference example when some people face multiple problems such as the cross-organization of government digital services and cross-authority, the coexistence of new and old systems, the need for integration, and the limited resources that require the introduction of civil collaboration. Therefore, like all mountain friends, vowing “never again” is a lie after all, always under the temptation of invincible beauty and moving achievements, carrying a backpack and starting the next journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>葉寧</name></author><category term="project" /><category term="開放政府" /><category term="登山申請一站式服務網" /><category term="青年參與" /><category term="協作" /><category term="工作坊" /><category term="公私協力" /><summary type="html">It's not that hard to get close to the mountains!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/00af78663a0fe6c4be1174b28993e9d9f5ee25af.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/00af78663a0fe6c4be1174b28993e9d9f5ee25af.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
